# JPG-to-PDF CLI Tool

JPG to PDF is a simple Python script which converts all the images into PDF format and then merges all the images as one single PDF. 
**Note:** The script works only for pictures clicked in portrait mode.

## Working
The script only takes two inputs.
1. The directory where the images are stored.
2. The name of the output PDF file.

The output PDF is saved in the same directory.

**Note:** The directory should contain only the images to be converted to PDF.
