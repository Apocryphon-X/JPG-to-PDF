# JPG-to-PDF

JPG to PDF is a simple Python script which converts all the images into PDF format and the merges all the images as one single PDF. In case you have an image which was accidentally clicked in landscape mode, the script will automatically convert it into portrait mode. <br />
**Note : The script works only for pictures clicked in portrait mode.** <br />

## Working
The script only takes two inputs.
1. The directory where the images are stored.
2. The name of the output PDF file.

<br /><br />
**Note : The directory should not contain any subdirectories having images in them, i.e., the diretory should contain only the images to be converted to PDF. The output PDF is saved in the same directory.** <br /><br />
